# Learning Go

This repository documents my journey learning the Go(Golang) from scratch.

🚀 **What you'll find here**:
- Exercises and notes based on the [Go: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide/) course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller and other books 
- Tools and utility programs I build along the way  
- Experiments, projects and more

🧠 I'm learning publicly. Mistakes and messy code included.

📁 Folder structure may change as I restructure and modularize based on what I learn.
